Data Storage 
matlb aisa kuch jahn par hm saray users ki info store kar skty hain 
file kay andar bh to we can store data but what actually happens kay file is not an efiicient way to store data and  file can not store images , videos and big files so what's the logic  to use it ? just for text 
here's come database which can store files, videos , images etc

TYPES OF DBS
SQL => data ko aik structure mai rakhna - tables like (rows and colums)
data scatered he hota h but woh aisay connected h kay usay tabular form mai likhna is much easy to write 
NoSQL => not only SQL (its a concept that is mai data objects ki form mai rkha jay ga)
is mai tables nh hoti hain object ki form mai data store hota h yahn p its easy as we have learn js 
mongoDB actually  hamary DB ka name h jo kay follow karta h noSQL ko   

what and why 
in order to store data and access and record it we uses databases 

terminologies - collections , documents , schemas , keys , models
we need to understand that backend term contains two major parts => 1- Application Server 2- database Server 
In our case we can consider that Application Server is NODE.js and database Server is mongoDB
Application server basically routes ko handle karta h and request ko accept karta h in simple words Application server ka kam h sab kuch karna bus data kay ilawa like  login log out 
ab database server ka main kam yeh h kay jaisy he Application server ko koi data chahiyay hota h ya phr su ko check karna h kay database mai yeh data h ya nh to he woh db ko call kar kay poochta h and db usko repsonse kardyta h acc to its need .

database Server 
fB kay pass customer collection hoga user collection hoga add collection hoga 
database => collection (alag alag type ka data hoga jo kay collection kehlata h) => document (1 person)

Code(mai yeh likhny say yeh hota h)      DataBase(mai yeh create hota h)
-----------------------------------      ----------------------------------
mongoose.connect                         database create ho jata h 
model create                             collection(banta h if we made user model to woh user collection bny ga)
CREATE                                   document (banta h)
